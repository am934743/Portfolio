This project included brand new marketing strategies that were to be applied for the various products and solutions that e4 offered. I worked directly with the marketing department to bring their vision to life. On this project, I handled all design and development elements. We built this website upon their existing platform of Wordpress websites that they use for their client EAP services.</p>

I worked closely with their marketing and board of directors to create an engaging and interactive experience that provided a place for the world to help children in need. </p>

Since day one of working there, I have been improving user engagement, helping increase generated leads, and updating the way Highland presents themselves on the web, and in their model homes. Not only have I been working on providing updates to website, I have also created an Interactive Sales Kiosk that is used in all of our new model homes - as well as some of our established communities.

                  <p>Lonestar Bowling is a website for a youth scholarship bowling tournament in the DFW Area. I have worked closely with the sponsors, The Bowling Shops,  who put this tournament on every year to create marketing materials, entry forms, and promotional flyers for upcoming sales and specials for their six pro shop locations across the DFW area. This website was a first for the tournament. It provided a platform for scoring updates to be seen by all who were participating in the event. We plan to create more similar platforms in the future for the numerous tournaments they run throughout the year. </p>

                  <p>Maxor National Pharmacy Services was my first web developer job. I started working here my Sophomore year of college as an intern. After three months of my summer internship - they extended an offer to hire me on full time as I completed school. During my time at Maxor - I had the opportunity to create online store fronts for each of our mail order pharmacies across the country. I also had the opportunity to work on digital signage screens and help with the development of their new corporate website in built with Drupal. This opportunity paved the way for me fall more in love with creating designs and applications on the web. </p>

                  <p>The main goal of this project was to create a new, fresh look to e4 Health Inc’s corporate website. This project included brand new marketing strategies that were to be applied for the various products and solutions that e4 offered. I worked directly with the marketing department to bring their vision to life. On this project, I handled all design and development elements. We built this website upon their existing platform of Wordpress websites that they use for their client EAP services.</p>

                  <p>This project was an absolute joy to work on. The main goal of this website was to bring Good Grief into the modern era of design and user interaction on their web platforms. Their previous website was not responsive, not engaging, and just plain didn't get their message off the way they wanted it to. I worked closely with their marketing and board of directors to create an engaging and interactive experience that provided a place for the world to help children in need. </p>

                  <p>At Highland Homes, I was hired to help usher in a new era of digital awareness and marketing strategy that they had previously dropped the ball on. Since day one of working there, I have been improving user engagement, helping increase generated leads, and updating the way Highland presents themselves on the web, and in their model homes. Not only have I been working on providing updates to website, I have also created an Interactive Sales Kiosk that is used in all of our new model homes - as well as some of our established communities. To view a sample kiosk, please <a href="https://kiosk.hhomesltd.com/walsh" target="_blank">click here</a>. <strong>Please note, this web application was intentionally developed not to be fully responsive. It is developed for a certain screen dimension used in our sales office. A fully responsive version is in the works and will be rolling out soon.</strong></p>
